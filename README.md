The API token for the football scores app is not included, you have to repalce it with a working token yourself. It is contained on line 76 of myFetchService.java, line should look like this: m_connection.addRequestProperty("X-Auth-Token","AUTH TOKEN GOES HERE");

Just replace that text with a real token.
